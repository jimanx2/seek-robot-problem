# Overview

## Problem Statement

The application is a simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimension 5x5 units.
•There are no other obstructors on the table surface.
•The robot is free to roam around the space of the table.
•The robot must be prevented from falling to destruction.
•Any movement that would result in the robot falling from the table must be prevented.
•However further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

## Additional Requirements

- The application core function must be highly customizable.
- The application should be well tested
- The application should be performant
- If new type of integration is needed, implementation should not be too difficult.
